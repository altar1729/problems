  <h1>Some Problems I am interested in: </h1>
  <p>Here is a list of problems which I am really interested in. This is not a comprehensive list but just a sample. For more problems, I find that my taste really aligns with most of the problems in the following three:

    <summary>Union-Closed Sets Conjecture</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This is probably a conjecture that lies in the heart of most combinatorialists. It was conjectured by Frankl in 1970s. Suppose we have a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ on the ground set $[n]$ which is closed under the operation of union, i.e. if $A,B\in \mathcal{F}$, then $A\cup B\in \mathcal{F}$. 
      Then, there exists an element $i\in [n]$ which is contained in at least $\frac{|\mathcal{F}|}{2}$ sets. There has been a recent development in this conjecture by
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Justin Gilmer
</a>,
which used very clever entropy technique to prove that there exists an element
$i \in[n]$ which is contained in at least
$\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}|\mathcal{F}|$ many sets.</p>

    <summary>Distinct Subset Sums</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This is one of my favourite problems. It was conjectured by Erdős in 1930s and is number 1 in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Erdős Problems website
</a>. Let $a_1\lt a_2 \lt a_3 \lt \ldots \lt a_n$ be distinct positive integers where all subset sums are distinct. Then, $a_n \geq c2^{n}$ for some constant $c>0$. </p>

    <summary>Induced Saturation for Posets</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>We call the family of sets $\{S_1,\ldots,S_k\}=\mathcal{S}\subset 2^{[n]}$, induced saturated for $\mathcal{P}$ 
        <ul>
          <li>if there exists no induced copy of $\mathcal{P}$ in $\mathcal{S}$, and
          <li> if for any $A\in 2^{[n]}\setminus \mathcal{S}$, $\mathcal{S}\cup \{A\}$ contains an induced copy of $\mathcal{P}$.
          </ul>
The minimum number of sets in an induced saturated family is called the induced saturation number for $\mathcal{P}$. Denote this by $sat^*(n,\mathcal{P})$. There are a lot of open problems in this area. The following two are my favourites:
 <ul>
    <li> Let $\Diamond$ be the diamond poset with four elements, one unique minimal, one unique maximal and two incomparable elements. Does the induced saturation number for the diamond poset $\geq n+1$, $sat^*(n,\Diamond)\geq n+1$?
     <li> Given any poset $\mathcal{P}$, do we have a linear upper bound in the dimension $n$ for the induced saturation number, $sat^*(n,\mathcal{P})=O(n)$?
     </ul>

    <summary>Kahn-Kalai II</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The original Kahn-Kalai conjecture was proved by Pham and Park in 2023. However, the second Kahn-Kalai conjecture is still open. Here, instead of focusing on general monotone families,
      one looks at the specific situtation of subgraph containments. There has been several improvements recently by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

    <summary>Sunflower Conjecture</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A family of sets $\mathcal{F}=\{F_1,\ldots,F_r\}$ is called an $r$-sunflower if there exists a core $C$, and $r$ sets called petals $P_1,\ldots,P_r$ such that $F_i=C\cup P_i$. Erdős and
      Rado proved that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of $s$-element sets and $|\mathcal{F}|\geq s!(r-1)^s$, $\mathcal{F}$ contains an $r$-sunflower. They conjectured that there exists a constant $c(r)$
      such that for every $s$, any $s$-element family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ satisfying $|\mathcal{F}|\geq c(r)^s$ contains an $r$-sunflower. Recently, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
 R. Alweiss, S. Lovett, K. Wu, and J. Zhang
</a> proved a lower bound of the form $\Omega((rlog(s))^s)$.

    <summary>Unit Distances</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Suppose you have $n$ points in the plane. How many unit distances can there be among this $n$ points? Erdős proved a lower bound of $n^{1+O(1/loglog(n))}$ and conjectured that this should be
      the right asymptotics. The first upper bound has been established by Spencer, Szemerédi and Trotter which is $O(n^{4/3})$. Except special cases, this is still the best upper bound despite many efforts.
      Recently, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15679" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
 J. Pach, O. E. Raz, and J. Solymosi
</a> has introduced a new perspective for this problem using rigidity theory which I find really interesting to explore.

    <summary>Fourier-Entropy Conjecture</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Let $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to \{-1,1\}$ be a Boolean-valued function. We can represent it as a discrete Fourier series in the following form $$f(x):=f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\sum_{S\subseteq [n]}\hat{f}(S)\chi_S(x),$$
        where $\chi_S(x)=\prod_{i\in S}x_i$. By Parseval's identity, we have $\sum_{S\subseteq [n]}\hat{f}(S)^2=1$, thus we can treat $\hat{f}^2$ as a distribution over the subsets of $[n]$. 
      Define $Ent(\hat{f}^2)=\sum_{S\subseteq [n]}\hat{f}(S)^2log(1/\hat{f}(S)^2)$ to be the Shannon-entropy of this distribution. We also define the influence of the coordinate $i$ as the probability
      that the value of the function changes when we flip the $i^{th}$ coordinate, i.e. $Inf_i(f)=\mathbb{P}[f(x)\neq f(x^{\oplus i})]$, and the total influence as $Inf(f)=\sum_{i=1}^n Inf_i(f)$, which
      can be written as $Inf(f)=\sum_{S\subseteq [n]}|S|\hat{f}(S)^2$. The Fourier-Entropy conjecture states that there exists a constant $C>0$ such that for every Boolean function $f$, we have 
        $$Ent(\hat{f}^2)\leq C Inf(f).$$

    <summary>One-Independent Percolation</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>There has been a lot of work concerning percolation in the independent setting. Here we let, in a sense, two set of edges $S,T$ to be independent if $V(S)\cap V(T)=\emptyset$. If two edges share
      a vertex in common, we do not have independence. The set of measures on $G$ which satisfy these one-independence property and for the edge probabilities being open is $p$ is denoted by 
        $\mathcal{M}_{1,p}(G)$. Lots of problems which are known in the independent setting are open here. I am especially interested in the following: 
      <ul>
        <li>Let $f_{1,p}(G):=min(\mu(G \; \text{is connected}\;): \mu\in \mathcal{M}_{1,p})$ denote the connectivity function. What is $f_{1,p}(C_n)$ for $n\geq 6$, where $C_n$ is the cycle on $n$ vertices. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
 A. N. Day, V. Falgas-Ravry, and R. Hancock
</a>  determined the connectivity function for paths, complete graphs and cycles of length $\leq 5$. 
      </li>
       <li>Let $p_{max}(G)$ denote the supremum of $p$-values for which there exists a one-independent measure where each edge is open with probability at least $p$ (or with $p$ by a argument), but which does not
       percolate. What is $p_{max}(\mathbb{Z}^n)$, or what is $lim_{n\to \infty}p_{max}(\mathbb{Z}^n)$? <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
 V. Falgas-Ravry, V. Pfenninger
</a> has made some progress towards this by showing that $lim_{n\to \infty}p_{max}(\mathbb{Z}^n\times K_n)=4-2\sqrt{3}.$
       </li>
        <li>Is it true that under one-independent models, the threshold probability that there exists a giant component in the hypercube $Q_n$ is $\frac{1}{2}$? By a recent result of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
 P. Balister, T. Johnston, M. Savery, and A. Scott
</a>, it is known that $\frac{1}{2}\leq p_{giant}\leq 0.58$</li>

    <summary>Maker-Breaker on $\mathbb{Z}^2$</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Consider two players, one maker and the other breaker, playing the following game turn by turn. Maker starts by switching an edge on the underlying graph $\mathbb{Z}^2$. In the next turn,
      Breaker deletes one edge of the underlying graph permanently. Maker's aim is to construct an infinite connected component and Breaker's aim is to prevent Maker from achieving this. In this version,
      it is known that Maker has a strategy to win the game. However, there are many open variants of this game. The following two are intriguing: 
      <ul>
          <li> Suppose Maker switches on $a$ edges at one turn, and Breaker deletes $b$ edges permanently. For which $(a,b)$, Maker has a winning strategy and for which $(a,b)$, Breaker has a winning strategy.
        Even the simplest $(2,2)$ version is not known. 
          <li> Suppose, we work with a randomly sparsed version of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, i.e. before starting the game, delete each edge with probability $1-p$ independently of each other. Then start the game on this graph. What can be said in this case? An examplary paper is this paper
        written by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

    <summary>Sendov's Conjecture</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Suppose a complex polynomial $f$ of degree $n\geq 2$ has all of its zeroes in the unit disk $\{z: |z|<1\}$, then for each such zero $z_0$, there is a zero of the derivative $f'$ 
      in the closed unit disk $\{z: |z-z_0|<1 \}$. There has been a lot of improvements concerning this problem. It was known for $n\leq 9$ long before and in the last decade, Terry Tao has proved 
      it for $n$ sufficiently large. However, his method of compactness does not provide any quantitative bounds on how large $n$ should be. This is a dream project which is too hard, but I am interested in
      finding quantitative bounds, which would need completely new methods. </p>

    <summary>Simplexity of the Hypercube</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Consider the $n$-dimensional cube, $[0,1]^n$. Let $S$ be a family of $n$-dimensional simplices. $S$ is called a triangulation of the cube if, for all $\Delta \in S$, the vertices of $\Delta$ are a subset 
        of the vertices of the cube: $\{0,1\}^n$, and $\cup_{\Delta\in S}\Delta=[0,1]^n$, and distinct simplices are disjoint only meeting at faces.
        We denote by $tri(n)$, the minimal number of simplices which makes up a triangulation of the cube. What is the right asymptotics for $tri(n)$? This has some known lower bounds, which has been established using bounds on
        the maximum determinant of $0-1$ matrices.
